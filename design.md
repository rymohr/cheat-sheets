# Color

Start with grays and a single highlight color (your brand color). Add in variations of the highlight
color using the rules below:

- for darker variation, remove brightness and add saturation
- for lighter variation, add brightness and remove saturation

Pick an off-black based on your brand color (removing brightness, add saturation) -- or add a black overlay @ 80-90% opacity on top of your brand color and color pick the result.

Add state colors for error, warning, and success.

Brand + Black (brandish) + Error (redish) + Warning (yellowish) + Success (greenish)

# Typography

- Display
- Headline
- Title
- Subheader
- Body
- Caption
- Small

With four subtypes in each:
- default (80-100%) transparency)
- secondary (50-70% transparency)
- disabled (20-40% transparency)
- accent (your brand color or something very close)

Use transparency so the text looks good regardless of background color.
