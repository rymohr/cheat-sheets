# UX

- Audience: who are your ideal users?
- Goal: what big goal do they have in mind when they sign up?
- Tasks: what tasks do they perform daily when they log into your web app?
- Objects: what items do the users handle while performing these tasks?

List the key screens -- product and service area (account, settings, authentication, etc)

Work through app starting from sign-in. Where do users land when they login? Where do they usually go from there?

Ideal structure of each screen:

- One huge title
- Obvious navigation
- One list of objects (or a single object) per screen
- One prominent task per screen
- One prominent CTA per screen
